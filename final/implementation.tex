\section{Implementation}

EOM driver onboard phase shift is bad, (see figure) only allowing for shifts between $\lambda \in [0.23, 0.41]$. However, for reasons unknown, this onboard system simulatneously introduced some low-frequency noise which propagated through to the error signal. The frequency was left at 19.8 MHz with no onboard phase delay as it produced the strongest and cleanest error signal. Phase delay was instead accomplished using variable length 50$\Omega$ BNC cables, with a 1.5m cable producing the strongest signal.
