\section{Project Deliverables}

\subsection{EOM-based optical setup}

talk about which lasers are used, etc.


\subsection{Fast Analog Laser Control Feedback Circuit}

Constructed single channel demodulation.

\subsection{New vs. Old System Characterization}

Revised set of metrics. Explain how, at time of activation, master laser tables were not really accessible due to whatever.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Error signals as a function of pump/probe power
    \item Error signals as a function of temperature
    \item Slope around locking points
    \item Noise (mVpp) around locking points
\end{itemize}
