\section{Conclusion}

The UBC Quantum Degenerate Gases Laboratory is currently using an acousto-optic modulator-based system to lock a diode laser to a specific frequency.  This system is frequency limited, and is incapable of providing the narrow linewidths that they require for their experiments. \\

This project was aided immensely by the research staff in the UBC Quantum Degenerate Gases laboratory led by Dr. Kirk Madison. Dr. Madison provided direct guidence on theoretical matters and contributed significant physical resources. Gene Polovy and Will Gunton of the Madison Group were extremely helpful with the physical setup, and with locating equipment. Janelle van Dongen provided significant assistance with the laser control instrumentation and data acquisition. Further thanks goes to Dr. David Jones, Dr. Jim Booth, Mariusz Semczuk, Koko Yu, Kahan Dare and Kais Jooya for their suggestions and guidance.
