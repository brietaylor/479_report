\section{Conclusion}

The UBC Quantum Degenerate Gases Laboratory is currently using an acousto-optic modulator-based system to lock a diode laser to a specific frequency.  This system is frequency limited, and is incapable of providing the narrow linewidths that they require for their experiments. \\

The construction of an electro-optic modulator based laser locking system is proposed.  The goals of this system are to provide a tighter linewidth than the existing system.  This is done by taking advantage of the higher bandwidth capabilities of the EOM, to provide a control system with a faster response than the existing system. \\

Additional benchmarking is also proposed, to compare key performance metrics of the new system to the previous system. \\

The expected time period to be spent in construction is short, but a large amount of time is set aside for debugging.  This ensures that the project should be fully completed, barring major complications, in which case a fully constructed unit will still be delivered with characterisation to be done in the future.
