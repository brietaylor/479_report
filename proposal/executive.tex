\section*{Executive Summary}

This project, sponsored by the UBC Quantum Degenerate Gases
Laboratory---Madison Group, aims to build and characterize a high
fidelity, small linewidth, laser frequency locking system based on the
Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking method.

Existing systems at the sponsors' laboratory are already based 
on the PDH method, but use a slightly different approach.  Both the 
existing and proposed systems lock to a vapor cell.  The
existing locking unit uses an acousto-optic modulator, which uses acoustics
to produce a frequency-shifted diffraction pattern.  This pattern is filtered
through a vapor cell, and then coupled into a photosensor.  From there,
frequency-shifted parts are extracted, which gives us an error signal.  This
error signal locks the diode laser's control system to the resonant frequency
of the chosen element.

Acousto-optic modulators, however, are mechanically limited to a frequency
of about 200 kHz.  This results in a system response speed on the order of
10kHz, which increases the linewidth of the laser.  Electro-optic modulators
use a different effect---the Pockels Effect, and
do not share this defficiency.

A locking unit based on an electro-optic modulator will be built, and its
performance will be compared to the existing AOM-based locking unit.

There will be three stages to the project:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Measure the operating parameters of the existing system
 \item Build the electro-optic modulator based system
 \item Measure the operating parameters of the new system, to compare to the old one.
\end{enumerate}
