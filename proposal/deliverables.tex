\section{Deliverables}

\subsection{EOM-based optical breadboard setup}

The sponsor already has optical breadboards, as well as a supply of optical equipment which we can use.  We must set up an optical breadboard in a configuration which includes the electro-optic modulator (EOM).

\end{figure}

We must select an appropriate EOM for this purpose which has appropriate characteristics TODO Jeff/Steve we need to pick one to solidify the proposal.

This deliverable should be relatively low-work, as the sponsor already has a working setup, and all that is required is to replicate this setup using an EOM instead of an AOM.

\subsection{Fast Analog Laser Control Feedback Circuit}

Construct an analog feedback circuit to provide an error signal.  The feedback circuit should take advantage of the improved frequency response of the EOM (compared to AOM).  It should have a characteristic response time on the order of 1MHz, as opposed to the 10kHz response time of the existing AOM-based solution.

\subsection{New vs. Old System Characterization}

Measure the performance of the existing AOM-based system, as compared to the new, EOM-based system.  Parameters that are important are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Laser linewidth
    \item Closeness to expected frequency
    \item Frequency response of the error signal
    \item Noise resistance of the two systems
\end{itemize}

Our system should improve upon the existing system in quality of frequency lock, as well as the speed of the lock.  It should not introduce any new noise, and both systems should create a lock close to the desired frequency.
